## Discussion

### Efficiency Issue (issue #4)

- [ ] Chaode: update the document accordingly

Chaode will submit the update in github and open a PR

Volunteers to review the PR: Italo, Sergio and Phil

### Clarify RFC8348 container terminology (issue #13)

- [x] Sergio: provide some text proposal to clarify the use of term container within this document

The term 'container' may have a broader meaning that the term 'holder', including bins, cabinets, ...

However, in the context of RFC8348 and in the context of components defined in the base inventory model, the term 'container' and 'holder' look synonymous

Agreed to use the term 'container' in this document, providing a definition as proposed in github and add an appendix with a terminology mapping to show e.g., that the term 'container' in this draft maps with the term 'holder' in other models

The terms 'container component' or 'YANG container' can also be used when needed to avoid confusion/ambiguity.

- [ ] Chaode: update the document as agreed

### Part number (issue #15)

Model changes proposed by Chaode has been reviewed during the call

The definition of part-number of the component has been updated based on the discussion

The part-number attribute is not applicable to NE. It has been agreed to rename the attribute as assembly-id as a working name and open a new issue to refine the name and description of the assembly-id attribute: see issue xxx

- [ ] Chaode: update the YANG description for the part-number

Chaode will submit the YANG changes in github in the same PR as discussed for issue #4

### Guidelines for component specific attributes (issue #5)

Chaode has a concern with removing the class attribute. Without this attribute it would not be possible to do some filtering to retrieve all the components of a given class

This issue requires further discussion in the next call(s)
