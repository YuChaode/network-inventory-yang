## Discussion

### Part number related issues (issues #15 and #33)

The YANG descriptions in the I-D version uploaded for IETF 119 are not fully aligned with the descriptions agreed during the call on February 21, 2024

- [ ] Chaode: update the definitions in the YANG model to align with the definitions in [2024-02-21 Base Network Inventory weekly call](https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/blob/main/minutes/minutes-2024-02-21.md)

### Software patch (issue #6)

Proposal from Chaode discussed: https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-yang/files/14352759/Modeling.of.Patch.Software.pptx

Agreement reached to add a software-patch-rev attribute for the components

Note: the attribute name has been chosen to clarify that the patch is a SW patch and to align with the naming convention used for HW, FW and SW versions

Agreement to define the software-patch-rev attribute as a list

It has been discussed whether there is always a single SW instance per component or there could be multiple SW instances running on the same component

It was pointed out that the SW inventory extension model allows modelling the cases where multiple SW instances are running on the same HW component

The base model can support HW components that support a single SW module. Complex configurations where an HW component can support multiple SW versions can be modelled using the SW inventory extension model: in this case, an HW-only component instance will have only the hardware-rev and it will contain one or more SW-only child component instances, which will have only the software-rev attribute

Agreement to keep only onw software-rev attribute per component

Agreement to add the software-patch-rev attribute (as a list) also for network elements

- [ ] Chaode: update the YANG model and the draft as agreed during the call

It is not clear why for the network elements, the hardware-rev is defined but the firmware-rev is not defined: it should either have both hardware-rev and firmware-rev or none

This discussion will be tracked as a new open issue #40

- [ ] Italo/Chaode: check with Fabio about the previous discussion in CCAMP WG

We can later revise the motivations discussed in CCAMP WG and update the model as appropriate.

There was also a question about the management of SW upgrades (including patches): it is not fully clear whether this is in the scope of inventory model or of ALMO

This discussion will be tracked as a new open issue #41

- [ ] Prasenjit: provide more detailed description for this issue
