## Discussion

### Modelling of fibers and cables (issue #32)

The 'physical span' is the end-to-end collection of strands between the access ports

The 'physical span' can be unidirectional or bidirectional ...

Multiple 'physical spans' can be contained within a single cable or go through multiple cables

The 'physical span' can be modelled as a link in the 'physical network' topology proposed in [draft-wzwb-ivy-network-inventory-topology](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-wzwb-ivy-network-inventory-topology)

It was pointed out that the term 'physical network' is not fully correct since the topology is reporting an abstract view of the physical network: the term 'abstract physical network' has been proposed as an alternative

The 'abstract physical link' can support an OTS link in the WDM topology or an ETH link in the ETH topology

The key question is whether there is a need to model the cables in the inventory model

Further discussion is also required about the need to report within the inventory of the fibers/cables within a network element
