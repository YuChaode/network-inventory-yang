## Chaode's latest changes to the main branch

## Proposed LS reply to BBF

It may be worthwhile providing more details on the rationale for not adopting the schema mount:
- having a standard inventory even if the device model is proprietary;
- decoupling the NBI from SBI would allow some filtering/abstraction not to expose information which is needed by the domain controller but not by the hierarchical controller;
- having a common network inventory model for optical, IP and MW networks even if the reference standards at the SBI are different.

It may be also worthwhile requesting some details about BBF requirements to support configuration for network inventory

- [ ] **Italo**: send these comments to the IVY WG list
