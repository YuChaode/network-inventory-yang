## Discussion

### Software patch for NEs and components (PR #43)

This PR has been reviewed, approved and merged

This PR will close issue #6

### Missing component location attribute (issue #42)

Operators have raised concerns on the OpenConfig approach of using a free-form string that allows different formats from different vendors

Operators would like to harmonize the format(s) of the location sting: if converging on a single format is not possible, defining few standard options is still better than a free-form string

A possible translation into YANG of the string pattern defined in ONF TR-547 could be the following YANG tree:

```
   +--ro position
   |  +--ro ne-name        string
   |  +--ro rack?          uint8
   |  +--ro shelf?         uint8
   |  +--ro sub-shelf*     uint8   // when ../shelf
   |  +--ro slot?          uint8
   |  +--ro sub-slot*      uint8   // when ../slot
   |  +--ro port?          uint8   // when (not ../slot and not ../shelf and
   |                               //       not ../rack) or (../slot)
```

The only pending issue to investigate is whether a uint8 data type is sufficient or it should be extended to uint16 or further

It was pointed out that forcing unsigned integer could be too constrained and a free-form string can be preferable:

```
   +--ro position
   |  +--ro ne-name        string
   |  +--ro rack?          string
   |  +--ro shelf?         string
   |  +--ro sub-shelf*     string   // when ../shelf
   |  +--ro slot?          string
   |  +--ro sub-slot*      string   // when ../slot
   |  +--ro port?          string   // when (not ../slot and not ../shelf and
   |                                //       not ../rack) or (../slot)
```

It was also pointed out that this information is duplicated of the component hierarchy so the question is whether this information should be build by the server and exported through YANG or by the client (and not exposed in YANG, and outside the scope of this I-D and of standardization in general).

Operators prefer that this information is built by the server and exported through YANG using a common/standardized format.

Next steps:

1) get feedbacks from IP and MW vendors on the ONF TR-547 format (translated to YANG):

```
      +--ro location
      |  +--ro ne-name        string
      |  +--ro rack?          uint8
      |  +--ro shelf?         uint8
      |  +--ro sub-shelf*     uint8   // when ../shelf
      |  +--ro slot?          uint8
      |  +--ro sub-slot*      uint8   // when ../slot
      |  +--ro port?          uint8   // when (not ../slot and not ../shelf and
      |                               //       not ../rack) or (../slot)
```

2) get feedbacks from Optical vendors on the ranges of the integer fields (in ONF TR-547 string there is no range defined)
